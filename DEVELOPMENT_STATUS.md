## **Phase 3: Advanced Features (Pending)**

### ✅ FR-6: Multimodal Integration - **COMPLETED**
**Date:** October 3, 2025
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED AND TESTED**

**Implementation Details:**
- ✅ Created a new `MultimodalInput` component to unify text, voice, and image inputs.
- ✅ Merged functionality from the old `MessageInput` and `VoiceControls` components.
- ✅ The right-side action button dynamically switches between "Send" (for text) and "Record" (for voice).
- ✅ Integrated push-to-talk voice recording using `PanResponder`.
- ✅ The attachment button for image selection is preserved on the left.
- ✅ Refactored `ChatScreen.tsx` to remove the old input components and state, replacing them with the single `MultimodalInput` component.
- ✅ Added a visual indicator that displays the recording duration.
- ✅ Obsolete `MessageInput.tsx` and `VoiceControls.tsx` files have been deleted.

**Key Features Implemented:**
- Unified input bar with attachment, text input, and a dynamic send/record button.
- Seamless transition between text and voice input modes based on user action.
- Maintained existing functionality for image attachment and preview.
- Simplified `ChatScreen` state management by removing input mode switching logic.

**Issues Encountered & Resolved:**
- **Issue:** Needed to combine two separate components into a single, cohesive one.
- **Resolution:** Created the `MultimodalInput` component from scratch, carefully porting over logic for text, image, and voice handling into a single file and ensuring their states did not conflict. The UI was designed to be intuitive, with a primary action button that adapts to the current context (typing vs. not typing).
