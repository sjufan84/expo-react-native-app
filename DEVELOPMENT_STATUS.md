## **Technical Notes & Dependencies**

### Dependencies Installed:
- ✅ @livekit/react-native - LiveKit React Native SDK
- ✅ @livekit/react-native-webrtc - WebRTC support
- ✅ livekit-client - LiveKit client for E2EE support
- ✅ react-native-worklets - Worklets plugin for reanimated
- ✅ react-native-worklets-core - Core worklets functionality
- ✅ react-native-image-picker - Image selection
- ✅ react-native-reanimated - Animations
- ✅ @react-native-async-storage/async-storage - Local storage

### Platform Configuration:
- iOS: Info.plist permissions configured (microphone, camera, photo library)
- Android: AndroidManifest.xml permissions configured
- Theme system supports both light and dark modes
- Permission handling with user-friendly rationale dialogs

### Architecture Decisions:
- **State Management:** React Context API (AgentContext + ThemeContext)
- **Navigation:** React Navigation v6 with Stack Navigator
- **Styling:** Custom theme system (NativeWind ready for Tailwind)
- **Audio:** LiveKit's built-in audio handling with custom AudioService
- **Permissions:** Centralized PermissionService for all platform permissions
- **Error Handling:** User-friendly alerts with recovery actions

### Recent Fixes (October 3, 2025):
1. ✅ Fixed `event-target-shim` module resolution warnings
   - Updated `metro.config.js` with proper module aliasing
   - Added resolutions in `package.json` to force version 6.0.2
2. ✅ Fixed missing `react-native-worklets/plugin` Babel error
   - Installed `react-native-worklets` package
3. ✅ Fixed missing `livekit-client` dependency
   - Installed `livekit-client` for E2EE support in LiveKit
4. ✅ Added Expo Dev Client support
   - **IMPORTANT**: Expo Go doesn't support LiveKit (native module)
   - Must use custom dev client build - see `BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
   - Installed `expo-dev-client` package
   - Updated scripts for dev client workflow
5. ✅ Fixed EAS Build dependency conflicts
   - Removed `@livekit/components-react` (web-only package not needed for RN)
   - Added `.npmrc` with `legacy-peer-deps=true` for EAS builds
   - EAS Build now uses legacy peer dependency resolution

### Next Steps:
1. Complete FR-3: Voice Communication (VoiceControls, Waveform, VAD)
2. Implement FR-4: Text Chat Interface (MessageList, MessageBubble, Input)
3. Add FR-5: Image Upload and Sharing (Picker, Preview, Transmission)
